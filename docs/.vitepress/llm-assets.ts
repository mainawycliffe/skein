/**
 * Serving the site's LLM-facing surface: `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, and a raw `.md` twin of
 * every page.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the two bundles are already generated (`pnpm docs:llms`) and already
 * curated by hand, but they live at the **repo root** — so before this, nothing served them. An
 * agent pointed at the docs site got a 404 on the one path the convention says to try first, and the
 * only working copy was a raw.githubusercontent.com URL. llmstxt.org puts `llms.txt` at the site
 * root; that is the whole point of the filename.
 *
 * Why the root files are read rather than duplicated into `docs/public/`: two copies of one file is
 * the defect shape this repo pays for most. `llms.txt` is hand-written and `llms-full.txt` is
 * concatenated in a deliberate order ("Order matters — it's the narrative", per its generator), so
 * they have exactly one author each. This module copies them at build time and streams them in dev;
 * `pnpm docs:llms` stays the only thing that writes them.
 *
 * Why per-page `.md` twins are emitted rather than linking to GitHub: a deployed site and `main` are
 * not the same content, so a "view as markdown" link to raw GitHub shows a reader a different page
 * than the one they are on. Same-origin twins also need no network and no CORS, and they give an
 * agent a URL per page instead of one 636 KB bundle.

 * twin exactly where the client computes it should be. `useData().page.relativePath` is the same
